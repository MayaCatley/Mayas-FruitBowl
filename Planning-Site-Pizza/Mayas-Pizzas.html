<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>For Sprint 1 I made a program that allowed the user to view a pizza menu and then order a pizza. Sprint 1 has worked well,
as it completes the important and necessary features my first version requires. In my next sprint (Sprint 2) I would like to have a way for
the user to "eat the fruit", and essentially be able to take fruit away from the total, I would also like to have a delivery and pickup option,
as well as a way to add fruit to the total value. The look of the program is easy to understand, due to the line formating. In
later versions I will need to validate the users answers, as so far the program just producers an error message, instead of this
the program should helpfuly inform the user that they have entered an invalid entry, and ask them to try and answer the question
again. Later on in the program I will also need to add cost values to the different pizzas, as well as adding more pizzas to
the menu so the user has more to choose from. It could be an interesting idea to add different options that the user can pick
that would then add more money to their total, such as choosing extra cheese, or maybe a different type of pizza base.</p>
<hr>
<hr>

	<h1 id="Sprint2">Sprint Two</h1>
<p>The aim of Sprint Two is to give the user the option to get their order delivered or the option for the user to pick it up
	themself. Sprint Two should also allow the user to add more pizzas to their order and to remove pizzas they no longer want.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>Sprint 2 has been effective in terms of picking either delivery or pick-up and then also having the option to order
more pizzas and remove pizzas, for my future sprints I will need to validate these new features, as well as fixing my error
messages. For Sprint Three I would also like to find a way to add costs to the users total order, have an option for the users current order to be
printed, change whether or not the user wants to get their pizza delivered or if they want to collect it, and have the option
to confirm their order.</p>
<p>I came across a few problems whilst working on this Sprint, such as finding away for the delivery and pickup option to then
take the user to the pizza option list. It would continue to ask the user whether or not they wanted delivery or pickup, so I had
to find a way to redirect the user to the right place and made sure the program stayed there. I also struggled with the print
order function, as it wouldn't update after the user had added or removed a pizza from their order, this was because the pizza list
that was printed out when the user selected the print order function was inside the loop, this meant that everytime the option list
was printed out, the pizza list/ print order option would reset. And therefore would never print out the correct values. To fix
this problem, I took the pizza list outside of the loop which was an easy fix.</p>

	<h1 id="Sprint3">Sprint Three</h1>
<p>This aim of Sprint Three I would also like to find a way to add costs to the users total order, have an option for the users
current order to be printed, change whether or not the user wants to get their pizza delivered or if they want to collect it,
and have the option to confirm their order. I would also like to fix the formating of the program, and have it print out much more
like an actual receipt would.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint Three works very well and I am very pleased with how the program is running, and while it took me quite a while, I am
very glad I spent as much time as I did trying to make the program print out like a receipt, as I think it makes the program much
cleaner and easier to use. I am also happy with the accuracy of the costs, as I have tested multipul times, and the cost is always
correct. I think it worked well that I added the toppings for each pizza, as now the user can see what they are ordering, this
will also make it easy for me to customise the pizzas in Sprint Four.</p>
<p>Many problems arose whilst making this sprint such as not having a checkout option, this means the user has to select quit
for the program to stop, in the next sprint this is definetly something I would have to fix as it is a crutial option for ordering
a pizza. I also need to validate the users answers, although I will probably do this after adding the customise option. I also
think it could be a good idea for the user to view previous orders, so they could see the customer history.</p>
<hr>
<hr>

	<h1 id="Sprint4">Sprint Four</h1>
<p>The aim of Sprint Four was to finish the printed program, so that all Sprint Five had to do was be validated. This means that
Sprint Four should include the customisable pizza option and the resulting cost, view previous orders and confirm the order.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint Four works very well and is esentialy finished aside from validation. The new customisable pizza function works well,
and the previous order option works great. The printed our program needs a little bit of refining in terms of spacing, but on
the whole looks effective.</p>
<p>There are many things I would liked fixed in the final sprint, such as the discription after the user selects either
	delivery or pickup ...</p>
<p>			'date': '2021-07-21', 'name': 'Maya', 'type': 'Delivery', 'items': [], 'phone': '0237468564', 'address':
	'31 Khandallah Road'</p>
<p>I would also like to change the message the program finishes on, as currently the program ends on "Thank you, please
select from the following options menu", as the program has ended and therefore no other options menu with be printed.
I will need to do a lot of validating in Sprint Five for things like the customers name, and making sure its less than 50
charcters long, also making sure the phone number is 8 digits, finding a way to validate the delivery location, and making
sure that there is a helpful error message for every possible mistake the user could make.</p>

<hr>
<hr>

	<h1 id="Sprint5">Sprint Five</h1>
<p>This aim of Sprint Five is to fix a few formating and error messages, and to validate as much of the program as I can, to
	ensure that it is as user friendly as possible..</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint Five works great, and I am very happy with how my program turned out. It runs cleanly and the validation all works well,
I was able to validate the phone numbers to be the right length and format, as well as making the name and address be a certain length.
With all possible user inputs that could require validation, I have also included a helpful error message that would advise the user
on how they could avoid the error in the future.</p>

<h2>What my Project Backlog looks like now</h2>

<br>
<hr>
<h1> Relevant Implications Summary</h1>
				<p>remember to describe and then address</p>
<hr>
<h3>Future Proofing</h3>
<p>What is it? - Easy to update (adding new functionality and features -> new menu item and new function (function based build)),
easy for another developer to work on and improve -> code commented, doc typing, program starts with main function (easy to
understand how the code works).</p>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>What is it? - Program works properly -> does not crash, everything works properly(eg. total amounts) -> regulary and systematcly
tested after each sprint (role play tests, other people use)</p>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>What is it? - Is the program easy to use -> informative user feedback, communicates if the user has made an error, fixes the
error on its own if it can (strip spaces, and uppercase and lowercase letter), uses a consistant user navigation system
(predictability) -> can return to main menu (0 to exit). Feedback when they have completed the task</p>
<hr>
					<h3>Buttons</h3>
					<p>You can apply the <code>btn</code> class to any element that requires a button style.</p>
					<p><a href="#" class="btn">Submit</a></p>
