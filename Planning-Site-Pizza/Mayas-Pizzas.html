<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>For Sprint 1 I made a program that allowed the user to view a pizza menu and then order a pizza. Sprint 1 has worked well,
as it completes the important and necessary features my first version requires. In my next sprint (Sprint 2) I would like to have a way for
the user to "eat the fruit", and essentially be able to take fruit away from the total, I would also like to have a delivery and pickup option.
	The look of the program is easy to understand, due to the line formating. In
later versions I will need to validate the users answers, as so far the program just producers an error message, instead of this
the program should helpfuly inform the user that they have entered an invalid entry, and ask them to try and answer the question
again. Later on in the program I will also need to add cost values to the different pizzas, as well as adding more pizzas to
the menu so the user has more to choose from. It could be an interesting idea to add different options that the user can pick
that would then add more money to their total, such as choosing extra cheese, or maybe a different type of pizza base.</p>
<hr>
<hr>

	<h1 id="Sprint2">Sprint Two</h1>
<p>The aim of Sprint Two is to give the user the option to get their order delivered or the option for the user to pick it up
	themself. Sprint Two should also allow the user to add more pizzas to their order and to remove pizzas they no longer want.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
 <p>Sprint 2 has been effective in terms of picking either delivery or pick-up and then also having the option to order
more pizzas and remove pizzas, for my future sprints I will need to validate these new features, as well as fixing my error
messages. For Sprint Three I would also like to find a way to add costs to the users total order, have an option for the users current order to be
printed, change whether or not the user wants to get their pizza delivered or if they want to collect it, and have the option
to confirm their order.</p>
<p>I came across a few problems whilst working on this Sprint, such as finding away for the delivery and pickup option to then
take the user to the pizza option list. It would continue to ask the user whether or not they wanted delivery or pickup, so I had
to find a way to redirect the user to the right place and made sure the program stayed there. I also struggled with the print
order function, as it wouldn't update after the user had added or removed a pizza from their order, this was because the pizza list
that was printed out when the user selected the print order function was inside the loop, this meant that everytime the option list
was printed out, the pizza list/ print order option would reset. And therefore would never print out the correct values. To fix
this problem, I took the pizza list outside of the loop which was an easy fix.</p>

	<h1 id="Sprint3">Sprint Three</h1>
<p>This aim of Sprint Three I would also like to find a way to add costs to the users total order, have an option for the users
current order to be printed, change whether or not the user wants to get their pizza delivered or if they want to collect it,
and have the option to confirm their order. I would also like to fix the formating of the program, and have it print out much more
like an actual receipt would.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint Three works very well and I am very pleased with how the program is running, and while it took me quite a while, I am
very glad I spent as much time as I did trying to make the program print out like a receipt, as I think it makes the program much
cleaner and easier to use. I am also happy with the accuracy of the costs, as I have tested multipul times, and the cost is always
correct. I think it worked well that I added the toppings for each pizza, as now the user can see what they are ordering, this
will also make it easy for me to customise the pizzas in Sprint Four.</p>
<p>Many problems arose whilst making this sprint such as not having a checkout option, this means the user has to select quit
for the program to stop, in the next sprint this is definetly something I would have to fix as it is a crutial option for ordering
a pizza. I also need to validate the users answers, although I will probably do this after adding the customise option. I also
think it could be a good idea for the user to view previous orders, so they could see the customer history.</p>
<p>Another thing I had to figure out for this Sprint was phone number validation, I tried mulipul different ways to acheive this.
I first made it so the phone numbers had to be 8 digits, but I soon realised that this would decline lots of valid phone numbers,
I then realised that the most accurate phone validation would be determining whether or not the number was valid based off the first
2-3 digits of the phone number, this was a lot better and meant that all phone numbers accepted were actualy valid. </p>

	<h1 id="Sprint4">Sprint Four</h1>
<p>The aim of Sprint Four was to finish the printed program, so that all Sprint Five had to do was be validated. This means that
Sprint Four should include the customisable pizza option and the resulting cost, view previous orders and confirm the order.</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint Four works very well and is esentialy finished aside from validation. The new customisable pizza function works well,
and the previous order option works great. The printed our program needs a little bit of refining in terms of spacing, but on
the whole looks effective.</p>
<p>I also added a "enter 0 to quit" option, I originaly had the user always selecting "Q" to quit, but I didn't like the way a minor quit
(just exiting back to the main menu) had the same command as a more major quit (exiting the program from the main menu). I think
this also make the program easier to use as it became predictable that if the user ever wanted to return they selected "0", and if
they wanted to fully quit they could choose "Q".</p>
<p>There are many things I would liked fixed in the final sprint, such as the description after the user selects either
	delivery or pickup ...</p>
<p>			'date': '2021-07-21', 'name': 'Maya', 'type': 'Delivery', 'items': [], 'phone': '0237468564', 'address':
	'31 Khandallah Road'</p>
<p>I would also like to change the message the program finishes on, as currently the program ends on "Thank you, please
select from the following options menu", as the program has ended and therefore no other options menu with be printed.
I will need to do a lot of validating in Sprint Five for things like the customers name, and making sure its less than 50
characters long, also making sure the phone number is 8 digits, finding a way to validate the delivery location, and making
sure that there is a helpful error message for every possible mistake the user could make.</p>

	<h1 id="Sprint5">Sprint Five</h1>
<p>This aim of Sprint Five is to fix a few formatting and error messages, and to validate as much of the program as I can, to
	ensure that it is as user friendly as possible..</p>

<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Sprint Five works great, and I am very happy with how my program turned out. It runs cleanly and the validation all works well,
I was able to validate the phone numbers to be the right length and format, as well as making the name and address be a certain length.
With all possible user inputs that could require validation, I have also included a helpful error message that would advise the user
on how they could avoid the error in the future.</p>
<p>I did lots of testing during this final Sprint to make sure that there were no errors, I did this by essentially testing as many
possible inputs as I could think of every time the program requested user input. By doing this I was able to see if my validation
was working. I was also able to remove all the strings of information, such as the one mentioned in Sprint 4.</p>
<p>As a whole I am super pleased with how my program functions, I was able to check off most of my Project Backlog (which can
be seen bellow) including features I added without the intention of completing such as customisable pizzas. I also think my planning
was very effective, as with a project as big as this one as it allowed for a clear overview of my project.</p>

<h2>What my Project Backlog looks like now</h2>

<h1 id="RelevantImplications"> Relevant Implications Summary</h1>
<hr>
<h3>Future Proofing</h3>
<p>Future Proofing was essential to ensure that my program would not only function properly now, but in the future too.</p>
<p>To do this, I made sure that my program was easy to update, I achieved this making sure it was easy to add new functionality
and features, I addressed this by adding new menu items and new functions (as my program is a function based build) frequently
to ensure no errors would arise. This is why it was so crucial to create the program by pushing each Sprint to Git to ensure that
if a function happened to break a section of the program it was easy to go back to the previously working program.</p>
<p>I also had to ensure that my program would be easy for another developer to work on and improve, I achieved this by making
sure that majority of my code was commented with helpful and descriptive sentences briefly explaining the purpose of functions and
lines of code, I also included doc typing in my code to document specific segments of my code, doc typing consists of
listing the classes, exceptions and functions, and a one-line summary. As well a starting my program with a main function, all of
these allow for the code to be easy to understand and simple to see how the code works.</p>
<br>
<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Functionality was crucial when making sure that my program worked well, and that it had no bugs and wouldn't crash</p>
<p>To do this I had to ensure that my program worked properly (for example when adding costs), and that it didn't crash,
this means that I had to regularly and systematically test my program after each Sprint. I achieved this by getting my friends to
test out my program as I went, and then finally getting my Dad to test it (which is the video above). It was so important
to test my code regularly and fix errors as they happened, as it would have been so much more difficult to try and fix
multiple errors at the same time. Another step I took to improve my program's functionality was to have separate component tests,
this meant that I could trial sections of my code separately, so I could deal with any errors on a smaller scale, rather than
trying to put the new code in straight away and all at once.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of some testing I did in regards to phone numbers. This was to test what numbers would be accepted and what
numbers wouldn't. It was super helpful to do this test first as I could find errors much easier than searching all my code to find errors.</p>
<img class="img-responsive" width="60%" src="assets/img/Test1.png" alt="">
<br>
<br>
<h3>Usability</h3>
<p>Usability makes sure that the user always knew what was going on.</p>
<p>To do this I had to ensure my program was easy to use, to do this I made user the user was always receiving informative user feedback
(I did this by constantly printing out an updated receipt with the users order, cost total, and choice of delivery/pickup/choose later),
I made sure to communicate with the user if they made an error (for example "This doesn't appear to be a valid phone number")
c, or coding it so my program was able to fix the error on its own; this was done by striping spaces, and converting uppercase and
lowercase letters, I also made sure I used a consistent navigation system which can be seen on the main menu and in the receipt.</p>
<p>I also made sure my program was predictable, I did this by making sure the user could always return to the main menu if they wanted
I addressed this by making "enter 0 to exit" always an option. I also made it so the user was always receiving feedback once they
completed a task, for example "You have selected to choose Delivery or Pickup later", this allows the user to understand what is
currently happening, and not force them to guess.</p>
